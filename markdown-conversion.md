# Engram Introduction

## Engram is an online text editor with vim-like bindings for note-taking and learning.
There weren't *many* editors like this, especially on the web for me to use, so in environments where *I could not install any apps*, and I had to rely on webapps. And on the web, there were no option that suits my needs.

## Engram is an opinionated tool
The engram philosophy follows a specific structure. The highest level is a Topic. Each Topic can be entered as a document editing view. Concept and Derivative Blocks are what makes up the Topic.

Concepts are Blocks that represent a concept. The content inside the Concept Block should be around a sentence long, and accurately summarizes the concept. 

Derivatives are Blocks that are derivatives of the concept. In other words, they're like a different representation of the concept. They could be 
- Probing Questions,
- Elaborations,  or
- Clozes for Anki integration.

## Elaboration derivatives are for elaborating
This is a simple derivative that contains your elaboration on your concept. It can range from personal thoughts, analogies, evidence and references.
